1. **Project Title**: KPOP Song Guessing Game
2. **Project Overview**: Brief description of the project and its objectives.
3. **Scope & Plan**:
  - **MVP**:
    - Play song clips and let users guess.
    - Clip length varies with difficulty level (easy - 5 sec, medium - 3 sec, hard - 2 sec, extreme - 1 sec).
    - Users enter their guesses for the Song Name & Singer.
    - Implement a basic scoring system:
      - Each game has 10 songs for guessing; each correct song name/singer is 5 pts, totaling 100 pts.
      - Users get three hints for each singer:
        - Number of members (-1pt)
        - Debut year (-1.5pt)
        - Most famous song (-2pt)
      - If the user guesses right after all hints are given, they can get 0.5pt.
      - Users have three chances to guess each song's name/singer.
      - No pt deducted for wrong guesses.
      - Bonus pts for correct guesses in one shot.
      - Implement a record system: TBD
        - Score record board and Time record board etc.
  - **Current Scope**:
    - Singers: 4th Generation Girl Groups/Female Soloists.
    - Language: English.
